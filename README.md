# Oblique Fortunes

Receive inspiration from Eno all day, whilst in the stark environs of the
command line!

## Say what?

This project contains [fortune][1] files comprised of Brian Eno's [Oblique
Strategies][2].

1. You must have the `fortune` program installed
2. Both files must live in a place `fortune` expects
3. You should make the call to `fortune` on "login" from a config file

It will display a random Oblique Strategy before the prompt in new Terminal
windows.

## Examples

- "Turn it upside down"
- "Accept advice"
- "Not building a wall but making a brick"

## Instructions

**OS X**

"Don't be afraid of things because they're easy to do"

```bash
bash < <(curl -sL https://raw.github.com/mattreduce/oblique-fortunes/master/get)
```

**DIY**

```bash
brew install fortune
git clone https://github.com/mattreduce/oblique-fortunes.git
cd oblique-fortunes
cp oblique* $(brew --cellar)/fortune/**/share/games/fortunes/
echo 'if command fortune >/dev/null; then fortune oblique; fi' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

## Thanks

To Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt for the Oblique Strategies.

To @zeke for inspiration and providing [the strategies][3] in an easy to
process format.

To @thoughtbot for the `successfully()` function I use in `get`.
